# Service Order

Using FreeBSD's rcorder for ordering of custom scripts. You can get dependencies
printed out using

```sh
rcorder services/*
````

If you'd like to get output which is suitable for parallel execution, add `-p`
to the previous command and every line will be a list of services which can be
started at the same time. The dependency graph is generated by

```sh
cd services
rcorder -g * >../dependencies.dot
cd ..
dot -Tpng dependencies.dot >dependencies.png
```
